# ray-tracing-1lsw

1. Start with `sw-test.ipynb` first. This one computes ray tracing equations with a fake Gaussian vortex. It was meant as a test, but it has proven useful!
2. `sw-actual.ipynb` is the one that actually reads data from your simulation files. You need to place a file in the same folder and change the `file_name` variable if you're using a different one.
